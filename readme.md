Reinforcement Learning Helper
=============================

The purpose of this library is to supplement the developer of the classic tools we need in reinforcement learning, 
such as a replay memory, a data collector which iterates agent's actions and environment's observation.
We also deliver a set of tools for the analysis of the reinforcement algorithms. 

Installation
------------

To install simply perform

```shell script
pip install -e .
``` 

Examples
--------

```python

```

- [ ] Comment all the methods and write the types
- [x] Visualizer class? (In order to save partial results)
- [ ] Refractor Analyzers and clean the code
- [ ] Require the Actors to receive only 2d vectors as input
- [ ] Make the library to work only with torch (use numpy only where strictly necessary)
- [ ] Think if there is the need to move some class to more appropriate files
