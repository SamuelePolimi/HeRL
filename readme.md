Reinforcement Learning Helper
=============================

The purpose of this library is to supplement the developer of the classic tools we need in reinforcement learning, 
such as a replay memory, a data collector which iterates agent's actions and environment's observation.
We also deliver a set of tools for the analysis of the reinforcement algorithms.
